# CW-ringtones

This is a collection of phone ringtones for learning morse code.

First, this video from the Ham Radio Duo YouTube channel is highly recommended on the best ways to learn morse code: https://youtu.be/z8m7VT7RCE0?si=C2xQbeIQjgAlNDZQ

Since ordering custom made parts and putting together a CW radio rig can take several weeks (or even months), it may be worth following along with this video in parallel with learning morse code (again, from Ham Radio Duo): https://youtu.be/FxbEwVJhOhM?si=0nBAHZ8BbA3DRmoL

In addition to the strategies suggested by the Ham Radio Duo, I have created this set of custom morse code iPhone ringtones to help me with memorization. 

The audio files in this repository are intended to be used for smart phone ringtones. They were created with the Morse-it app, which costs $9.99. A potential free option would be to use https://hamradio.solutions/visual_morse/ to manually record the codes.

Importing custom ringtones on iPhone is a royal PITA, but it can be done following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/en-us/120692

Users can choose which ringtones to use for various notifications, but here are some suggestions:

CQ - Default ringtone | Used when a transmitter is looking for someone to make contact with<br>
QSB - Timer | QSB refers means "fading signal" and is used when an operator is losing the ability to transmit<br>
YL - Female contacts | Abbreviation for Young Lady. In CW, 'young lady' is pretty much used for anyone, regardless of age.<br>
YF - Wife or Significant other <br>
OM - Male contacts | Abbreviation for Old Man. Again, 'old man' is used for any male contacts.<br>
WKG - Notifications for alerts for user's job | abbreviation for 'working'<br>
73 - | Shorthand for 'Fine Business'. Used at the end of a conversation much the same way as 'Best regards.'<br>
GM - Wake up alarm | abbr for Good Morning<br>
GA - Afternoon alarms| Good Afternoon<br>
GE - Evening alarms| Good Evening<br>
GN - Bedtime notification| Good Night <br>
QRM - Non-urgent social media app notifications| Shorthand for 'Interference'<br>
QTH - 'Find My' app notifications | Shorthand for Location<br>
WX - Weather Alerts | Abbr for Weather report<br>
<br>
As of this writing, there does not appear to be a way to set custom ringtones for specific apps in iOS, which is very annoying. You can still set distinct ringtones for various contacts and may be able to choose the notification alert for an app within the app itself.
