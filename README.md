# CW-resources

This is a collection of resources for learning morse code.

First, this video from the Ham Radio Duo YouTube channel is highly recommended on the best ways to learn morse code: https://youtu.be/z8m7VT7RCE0?si=C2xQbeIQjgAlNDZQ

Since ordering custom made parts and putting together a CW radio rig can take several weeks (or even months), it may be worth following along with this video in parallel with learning morse code (again, from Ham Radio Duo): https://youtu.be/FxbEwVJhOhM?si=0nBAHZ8BbA3DRmoL

In addition to the strategies suggested by the Ham Radio Duo, I have created a set of custom morse code iPhone ringtones to help me with memorization. 

The audio files in this repository are intended to be used for smart phone ringtones. They were created with the Morse-it app, which costs $9.99. A potential free option would be to use https://hamradio.solutions/visual_morse/ to manually record the codes.

Importing custom ringtones on iPhone is a royal PITA, but it can be done following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/en-us/120692

Users can choose which ringtones to use for various notifications, but here are some suggestions:

CQ - Default ringtone | Used when a transmitter is looking for someone to make contact with
QSB - Timer | QSB refers means "fading signal" and is used when an operator is losing the ability to transmit
YL - Female contacts | Abbreviation for Young Lady. In CW, 'young lady' is pretty much used for anyone, regardless of age.
YF - Wife or Significant other 
OM - Male contacts | Abbreviation for Old Man. Again, 'old man' is used for any male contacts.
WKG - Notifications for alerts for user's job | abbreviation for 'working'
73 - | Shorthand for 'Fine Business'. Used at the end of a conversation much the same way as 'Best regards.'
GM - Wake up alarm | abbr for Good Morning
GA - Afternoon alarms| Good Afternoon
GE - Evening alarms| Good Evening
GN - Bedtime notification| Good Night 
QRM - Non-urgent social media app notifications| Shorthand for 'Interference'
QTH - 'Find My' app notifications | Shorthand for Location
WX - Weather Alerts | Abbr for Weather report
